                We're so glad that our offer of UXDMC for free was so well received. 
                So many people joined up over the past 2 months and it's been great 
                to grow the community. <a href="#" class="header_link">The Free offer will be ending at 
                the end of the month of April and the CARE code will continue to be 
                good for 80% off any or all modules</a>
